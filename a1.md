# Crossword puzzle solver (using bactrack algorithm)
#### Details of the crossword-filling problem solution
To solve the crossword-filling problem, first, I have created a main class named Crossword.java which will solve a crossword board by taking 2 command line arguments. The first argument contains the location of `dictionary` file which contains words to put into the crossword-board to create a solution. The second argument contains the location of test board file which contains crossword board pattern to solve, where `+` sign represents a *Blank* square and `-` sign represents a *Solid (filled-in)* square.
After taking these arguments, I have created an object of the **Crossword** class to initialize two constans namely, `ALPHABET_LETTERS` and `LETTER_POINTS`. `The ALPHABET_LETTERS` constant stores a string of `26 alphabet letters`, these alphabet letters will be used one by one in the program to find a **single solution** for the crossword puzzle. The `LETTER_POINTS` constant is an array of **LetterPoints** objects, **LetterPoints** is an `inner class` to store the `points` of a letter to calculate the `score` of the solution at the end, which will be used in the program to calculate the `score`.
Using the file locations from the `run-time` arguments, the crossword board and `dictionary` is initialized in the `initialize()` method. To catch and handle any unexpected `exception`, I have surrounded the code with `try{}catch` to catch and show a message about the exception on the console.
The initialize method is responsible to make a legal board and give the program what it needs to solve the puzzle. In the start, three files are opened for reading i.e., *dict8.txt, test and letterpoints.txt files*. The `letterpoints.txt` file is hardcoded in the program because it is required by the program to calculate the `score`. After creating the `Scanner` objects and opening the streams, files have been read one by one. The ***DictInterface*** type object namely *`dictionary`* is created by initializing the **MyDictionary** object, which is the `implementation` class of the ***DictInterface***.
Then a board of squares, of the provided size from the test file, is created, the board is a `two-dimensional` array of **Square** objects, Square is an `inner class` to store the details of the square of the crossword board. After that two other arrays are also created which will store the solved words, namely `rowStr[]` and `colStr[]`. `rowStr[]` array will store the rows of **StringBuilder** objects and `colStr[]` array will store the columns of **StringBuilder** objects.
After the `initialization` of the crossword board, all the arrays and dictionary, my program will start solving the crossword puzzle by calling the `solve()` method which will return `true` on finding a `solution` and return `false` on `no solution`. This method is a `recursive` method like mentioned in the `README.md`. This method starts from the `first index` of the row and column. It will move forward and down, to find the first *Blank* square. If a *Solid (filled-in)* or a letter from `A-Z` is found then it will be appended to the end of each **StringBuilder** object of that row and column. If the appended letter is not a valid substring, it will `backtrack` and will return `false`. When a *Blank* square is found, it will append letter `‘a’` from the alphabet letters string to the end of **StringBuilder** object of that row and column. Then it will check If the substring is valid from `left-right` and `top-bottom`. If yes, then it will check if the rows and columns have reached the number of the `board size`, in other words, have reached the `limit`. If no, then it will check the next column using `recursion`. This step will also be repeated for the row. Finally, if rows and columns have reached the `limit` and they have produced a valid substring then it will return true as an indication that the puzzle is solved. If they have not produced a valid substring then it will `backtrack` again. It will check if the appended letter has not produced any valid `prefix` then it will remove that letter from the **StringBuilder** objects and will try next letter from the `alphabet`. It will continue this process until a `solution is found`. If not, then the `solution is not found` for that board.
